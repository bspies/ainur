> ...and he [Eru] made the first the Ainur, the Holy Ones, that were the offspring of his thought, and they were with him before aught else was made.

# Ainur
Ainur is a set of project management tools for working with front-end JavaScript projects.

## Ainur Build
The `ainur-build` package is a build sytem built on the power of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). It provides a simple, concise, use-case driven way of creating a project build. It can be used either as part of `ainur-project` or through a standalone API.

## Ainur Project
The `ainur-project` package is a project management system built on top of `ainur-build` to provide a way of declaratively specifying project structure and features using metadata.

## Installation and Configuration
First, install the npm module:
```sh
npm install **TODO**
```

*TODO: configuration*
