/*
 * This module exposes built-in Ainur features. Features are a kind of "named transform" for
 * modifying the built configuration. Each feature must export an `id` constant and an `apply`
 * function that takes both the Ainur build configuration as well as the Webpack configuration as
 * parameters.
